        <article>For any job in the field of CS or IT you first should have CS/IT and MATHS as your core subjects as
            these subjects help you build you base and also algorithm which helps you a lot in you programming. But
            don't worry if you did not have any of these subjects, you only need to give more time in practicing the
            subject you are lacking in. And if you are coming from a BIOLOGY background even though the steps are same
            for you because CS/IT needs maths as its core/mind hence you can't avoid it.</article>
