            <b>Intro:-</b>Hello There! Welcome to your perfect job finding partner!. I am <i>Anuj</i>. If you are
            interested to know why I made this website, please read this. This is my first website. I hope you would
            like it.This Idea came randomly in my mind with a video on my youtube account. That video was of mastering
            html in 2 hours. Although it may sound funny but its true. I think you would also like to know my
            qualifications, right? So nothing much. Just a student in class 12th, and a fun fact, I am from a non-math
            background. Reason? Because I was not good in maths in 10th so I couldn't take maths as ain subject in 11th,
            but when I came to know about cs, I couldn't help but only study maths more than any other subjects and now
            I now know at least 3 programming languages. But I am sure you would a hundred times better then me, right?
            Isn't that the reason why you are here?
            For getting more information just go to next page.
